add permissions for the users on api

Under these new settings, the anon and authenticated roles can execute functions defined in the api schema, but they have no automatic permissions on any tables. On a table-by-table basis, you can grant them permissions by running the following command:

grant select on table api.<your_table> to anon;
grant select, insert, update, delete on table api.<your_table> to authenticated;

api: https://fssupeeohwydsruwgitr.supabase.co
